            <p>When I first started exploring programming and technology seriously, I was advised to start a blog to document my growth. Back then, I didn’t know how to build or host a website, so I purchased a domain through Hostinger and used WordPress to get started. It was a great way to share my journey without worrying about the technical details. Earlier this month, when my subscription expired, I reflected on how far I’ve come in just a year. The biggest change? I realized I no longer needed to rely on someone else to host my site—I’ve learned how to do it myself. Now, I’m hosting my own blog and portfolio, and this is the first post on the new and improved teachweaver site!</p>
    
            <h2 class="section-heading">From Basic HTML to Customizing Bootstrap</h2>
            <p>When I first started, my knowledge of HTML was limited to what I had picked up as a kid styling Neopets guild pages—basic tags and colors, nothing fancy. Fast forward a year, and I’m now using Bootstrap to design responsive websites that look great on any screen size. I’ve also started customizing Bootstrap with SCSS to give my site a more unique and polished feel. SCSS has opened up so many possibilities for efficiency and creativity, and I’m excited to keep pushing those boundaries.</p>
            <p>One of my goals is to dive deeper into good design practices to make my sites as professional and accessible as possible. Design can make or break a website, so I’m committed to improving in this area. I’ve been loving courses from <a href="https://www.traversymedia.com/products/bootstrap-5-from-scratch-build-5-modern-websites">Traversy Media</a>, and they’ve been a great resource for learning about Bootstrap and responsive design.</p>
    
            <h2 class="section-heading">Tackling New Challenges</h2>
            <p>Rebuilding this site was a challenge I wasn’t sure I was ready for. A year ago, I barely understood JavaScript, and the idea of creating a functional blog from scratch felt out of reach. Now, I’m able to adapt code I find online, troubleshoot it, and make adjustments to fit my needs. It’s not perfect, but it works—and that’s a big win for me.</p>
            <p>The blog functionality I’ve built is simple but effective. I thought I’d need another platform to make it work, but I’m proud to say I’ve done it myself. That said, there’s plenty of room for improvement. My next steps include learning more advanced JavaScript to write custom features and exploring back-end management for smoother post handling. While my current system works, it feels clunky from my perspective, and I’m looking forward to making it more efficient. One of my immediate goals is to finish the second half of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12384268?start=15">Dr. Angela Yu’s Complete Web Development Course on Udemy</a>, which covers a lot of the skills I need to improve.</p>
    
            <h2 class="section-heading">Building Confidence Through Hands-On Projects</h2>
            <p>Beyond web development, I’ve made significant progress in understanding how computers and systems work. While I had built computers before, most of those projects were done with the guidance of my dad or friends. Over the past year, I’ve taken a more independent approach. I’ve disassembled and reassembled my PC, laptops, and even phones, just to learn how they function.</p>
            <p>I’ve also tackled several tech projects that have expanded my skills. For instance, I built a Pwnagotchi, set up a Pi-hole, and pieced together a homelab server. My homelab now hosts a variety of services, some of which are accessible online for my family to use. I’m especially proud of my Proxmox server, which runs virtual machines. One of those VMs serves as a coding environment I can access remotely through a VPN. To ensure my work is safe, I’ve also set up a backup sync to protect my projects.</p>
            <p>These hands-on experiences helped me pass both the CompTIA A+ 1101 and 1102 exams. They’ve also given me a deeper understanding of the concepts I’m studying and how they connect to real-world applications.</p>
    
            <h2 class="section-heading">Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>This past year has been full of learning, experimenting, and overcoming challenges I once thought were beyond me. On top of web development, I’m currently studying for my Network+ certification, exploring CoreWar, and diving into topics like malware, which has become a growing interest of mine. It’s exciting to think about where I’ll be in another year. As I continue building my skills, I’m eager to make my sites more polished, functional, and accessible. Stay tuned—I’m just getting started!</p>
