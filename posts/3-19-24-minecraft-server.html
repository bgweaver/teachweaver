              <p>I'm excited to share the latest developments in my home server journey! Recently, I set up a Minecraft server for me, my son, and his cousin to play together—an experience that was a big hit with the boys!</p>
              <p>Rediscovering Linux skills while setting up the Minecraft server was a refreshing experience. Though the initial setup was straightforward, it reminded me of the importance of regular practice. I stumbled over some basic commands, like "wget," and found myself relearning how to navigate between folders quickly in the terminal. Thankfully, I found helpful guidance from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KeepItTechie/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KeepItTechie</a> on YouTube, whose tutorial was really easy to follow. I subscribed to the channel as part of my plan to keep practicing Linux.</p>
              <p>One of the challenges arose when my 5-year-old son struggled with using a keyboard and mouse to play Minecraft (he's more accustomed to using the Switch). Determined to find a solution, I explored how to add controller support, leading me to switch from the basic Minecraft Java server to a Forge server. This change allowed my son to run the Controllable mod seamlessly. However, matching versions of Forge and mods between the server and client computers proved to be a bit tricky. I encountered various errors along the way, such as needing to kill Java because the old server was still running on the Minecraft port despite my attempts to stop and delete it.</p>
              <p>After troubleshooting and Googling solutions, everything fell into place. We had a blast yesterday when we created a large, pink horse farm on a cherry blossom village seed that I stumbled upon.</p>
              <p>Looking ahead, my oldest son occasionally plays Minecraft with his friends over Discord, sparking the idea of setting up a server for them as well. However, I anticipate challenges in ensuring simplicity for his friends to log on independently, as I won't always be available to assist with setup. I'm also not sure if my laptop is going to be sufficient to run additional servers on top of the music library, so I may need to look into other options as I move forward.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the journey of transforming my old laptop into a home server continues to be filled with challenges and rewarding moments. From rediscovering Linux skills to overcoming Minecraft server challenges, each step reinforces the value of learning and exploration. Stay tuned for more updates as we explore new possibilities with our home server setup!</p>
              <p>Happy crafting!</p>
