            <p>Now that summer break is here, I finally have more time to blog about my tech projects. My server setup
              has undergone a lot of changes since I started with an old laptop. Recently, my dad upgraded his PC and
              generously donated his old parts to me. I combined those with some parts I already had to build a
              serviceable computer. The only thing I had to buy was a couple of hard drives, which I've been picking up
              gradually when they go on sale. I installed Unraid on it and have spent the last few months exploring its
              features, with plenty of help from Space Invader One’s awesome videos. Here are a few of the most
              interesting things I’ve set up.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Tailscale</h2>
            <p>Wireguard is built into Unraid, but I chose Tailscale for my home VPN because it's so easy to use. While
              both are based on Wireguard and help me access my home network remotely, Tailscale is much simpler to set
              up. Setting up Wireguard required manually pairing keys between devices, which was a bit complicated for
              me. With Tailscale, I just download the client, log in, and verify the device. My wife’s device helped me
              test the usability, and she found Tailscale much easier to manage than Wireguard.</p>

            <p>Unlike my issues with Wireguard, I didn’t have any trouble using Tailscale to connect to other networks
              or websites. However, Wireguard caused some networks to block internet access if it was active first,
              which added to my frustration. Now, I can easily manage my server remotely with Tailscale as my VPN, using
              my server tower as an exit node. While I mainly use Tailscale on my phone and laptop, I’m planning to
              explore other VPN options once I learn more about VPN usage.</p>

            <p>However, routing my traffic through the server tower revealed my home IP address, ISP, and DNS server
              details, which wasn’t ideal for privacy. For now, I’m using Opera, which has a VPN and an ad blocker, but
              it’s limited to browser activity only. I plan to choose a dedicated VPN later to improve my security.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Pi-hole</h2>
            <p>Pi-hole is a key tool in my network, running in a VM on my Unraid tower. It blocks unwanted ads and
              tracking at the DNS level. At first, I had some issues with stability in a Docker container, but now it’s
              reliable after making it the static DNS server for my router. My wife sometimes gets frustrated when
              Pi-hole blocks Google-sponsored ads in her searches, but it’s effective in enhancing our online privacy.
              To ensure Pi-hole works even during power outages, I’m planning to move it to a Raspberry Pi. I currently
              use NextDNS as my upstream DNS server, but I might revisit Unbound in the future to customize my DNS
              resolution setup.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Home Assistant</h2>
            <p>Home Assistant has been a game-changer for making our home smarter. It’s running on a virtual machine on
              my server, and I’ve connected several smart switches to control the lights in our bedrooms and living room
              from one place. I repurposed an old Amazon tablet as a dedicated Home Assistant device, making it super
              easy to manage everything. By linking my Ring doorbell and cameras, I can monitor what's happening around
              the house, with motion alerts showing up on the tablet when needed. Automations like adjusting the
              thermostat when we're out and waking up the kids in the morning have made daily routines much smoother. My
              wife is a huge fan of this project, and it’s been really helpful in making our lives easier.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Docker Containers</h2>
            <p>I run a few Docker containers, mainly through Cloudflare, and I want to highlight a couple of my
              favorites. My parents love a container I set up for Mealie, a recipe manager that pulls recipes from
              websites. It’s been really helpful for them, even though it doesn't mesh well with our shopping and
              meal-planning. Having users outside my home has made me more careful and purposeful with my server. My
              server has only gone down once, and my mom was the first to let me know, which has made me more aware of
              my updates and work timing.</p>

            <p>The two Docker containers I use the most are Komga and Audiobookshelf. Komga is perfect for organizing
              and sorting my PDF and e-book collection, especially my programming and cybersecurity books from Humble
              Bundle. Audiobookshelf does an excellent job sorting and pulling metadata for audiobooks, but it has one
              annoying issue: the app stops playing at the end of each chapter if my phone is locked or if I switch to
              another app. I hope this issue gets resolved with the iOS app when it’s out of beta.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Running a home server has been an incredible way to practice skills that will help me as I continue my
              journey in the tech field. From hardware assembly and software configuration to networking, security,
              troubleshooting, and mobile device integration, these projects have given me hands-on experience across
              many areas. As I study for the CompTIA A+ certification, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how much of the
              material I’m already familiar with from building and maintaining my server. This journey has strengthened
              my passion for technology and inspired me to dive deeper into the world of IT.</p>
